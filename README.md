<br>This is a version of [FrankenUI](https://github.com/anotheregostar/FrankenUI/) based on [NillipussUI](https://github.com/NilliP/NillipussUI_1440p) rather than Powerof2, and should be compatible with additional Nillipuss UI features as they are released.

### Special Thanks:
**Nillipuss** has been invaluable in helping me create and maintain this UI. Pieces from NillipussUI should be compatible with **FrankenPussUI** by copying in the .xml files you want to add into your `FrankenPussUI` folder.
NillipussUI is highly recommended and you can find the 1080p version [here](https://github.com/NilliP/NillipussUI_1080p) and the 1440p version [here](https://github.com/NilliP/NillipussUI_1440p).

**Calmethar** was also very helpful when I started putting this UI together, particularly with the smaller buff window and spellbook. Their UI can be found [here](https://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=6959).

Special thanks as well to **Salty** and the rest of the Zeal team for adding all of these great QoL features to EQMac based UIs!
